I'm a first year Master's student at [UCSD CSE](http://cse.ucsd.edu/) department. I received my bachelor's in [computer science](http://www.in.tum.de/en.html) from [Technische Universität München](http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) in 2013.

My research interest lie broadly in computer networks, security and machine learning. In the past, I worked on network measurements and QoS routing in software defined networks. Here is my [résumé](/files/resume.pdf).

This site is still work in progress and will be extended in the near future.
