I'm a second year master's student at [UCSD CSE](http://cse.ucsd.edu/) department. I received my bachelor's in [computer science](http://www.in.tum.de/en.html) from [Technische Universität München](http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) in 2013.

My research interest lie broadly in distributed systems, security and machine learning. In the past, I worked on network measurements and QoS routing in software defined networks.

This summer, I interend at Facebook in Seattle on the awesome Care Machine Learning team. As my intern project, I built a (fake) name classifier that achieved >98% precision with >45% recall. The automations I deployed in Haskell using the classifier automate about 140 hours of reports per day.

Here is my current [résumé](/files/resume.pdf).

This site is still work in progress and will be extended in the near future.
